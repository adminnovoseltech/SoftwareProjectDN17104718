## Abstract
Handymano is Android application that is developed to connect regular users and tradespeople in a simple and user friendly platform. 
This application provides regular users with the functionality to create job ads for any of supported services as well as browsing for tradespeople in their desired area.
Tradespeople can leverage the platform to browse for job ads posted by the regular users and advertise their portfolio of previously completed projects that might attract potential customers.

## Project
This project is developed as a final project in my 4th year of part-time studies. 
Handymano is at the moment targeting users with Android version 7.0 and higher. 
In my effort to expand my skills and knowledge web application with React and Spring Boot will follow in the upcoming months as well as expansion in features on the Android platform.
