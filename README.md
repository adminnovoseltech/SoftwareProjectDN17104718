# Software Project - Denis Novosel - 17104718

#Introduction
Hi, my name is Denis Novosel and my student number is 17104718.
I am enrolled in Bachelor of Science(Hons) in Computing - part time schedule - and I am specialising in Software Development.

#What will the project do?
As my software project I will develop an Android application which will allow users to search for craftsmen based on their location.
Whether user's location is manualy typed in or current location is selected - application will browse for the craftsmen in the selected
category of the trade user is looking for based on the radius the person offering the service is willing to travel.

Application will also allow people who are offering the services to register, create their profile, showcase their previous work and projects,
receive feedback, set up their pricing and more. 

Technologies I plan to use with this project for now are Java with Android Studio, Google Maps API and AWS.

#Why is the project challenging?
It is challenging for multiple reasons: 
1. This is the first time I will work on the project that is intented to run on Android devices and using Android SDK.
2. The project will entail a lot of database interactions and networking including API calls.
3. I am not working in the Software Development role, but as a System Engineer so it will be interesting to see how I can
implement my current work experience and college practice.

#Who is the project for?
This project is for the end users who are willing to explore which services are being offered in their desired area as well as 
having the abiltiy to see the previous work of the craftsmen they are thinking about hiring.
Also, this project is aimed for craftsmen looking to offer their services.
Finally this project is for my own education purposes and exploring new areas of software development.

#Why should this project be attempted?
It should be attempted because it surely is challenging to use all these technologies and is complex enough to meet the required criteria.

#How is it different than what hasw been done in this area before?
In my research I have found websites which offer similar functionality but I've never found the concept wish to tackle.
Websites I have found require you to write your requirements whereas my application will help you find person you need within 2 minutes.
